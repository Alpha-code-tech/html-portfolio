    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Beyond academics and development, I love spending time on activities that keep me inspired, balanced, and connected to the world around me. My hobbies reflect my curiosity, creativity, and desire to keep learning in different ways.</p>

    <h2>Music & Expression</h2>
    <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I play the violin, an instrument I started learning back in primary school, and it’s become one of my favorite ways to express myself. I also earned a Grade 1 certification from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM). For me, music isn’t just entertainment — it’s a blend of discipline, emotion, and creativity that keeps me grounded and focused.

    <h2>Reading & Self-Learning</h2>
    <p>I love reading books, articles, and research that help me understand how things work — from science and medicine to technology and human behavior. Reading keeps me curious and helps me think critically, which also influences how I approach learning web development and medicine.

    <h2>Building & Creating</h2>
    <p>I enjoy exploring creative digital projects. Recently, I started learning web development, and I’ve been building small projects to improve my skills. I find it fascinating how coding allows me to turn ideas into something interactive and useful.

    <h2>Culture & Global Perspective</h2>
    <p>
        I’m also passionate about learning from different cultures and experiences. I participated in a UNESCO Institute for African Culture and International Understanding Conference on Promoting Global Citizenship through Cultural Education, and it helped me appreciate how culture connects people and ideas.

    <h2>Leadership & Mentorship</h2>
    <p>Helping others learn is something I’ve always enjoyed. In school, I often coached my classmates in science and math, and I still value mentorship and teamwork as key parts of growth.
