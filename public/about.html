<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>
Hi, I’m **Shalom Julius, a curious and self-taught **web developer from Nigeriawith a passion for turning ideas into interactive digital experiences. I started learning web development after completing my SAT and IELTS, channeling my curiosity and free time into something productive. Since then, I’ve been building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how to create clean, functional, and user-centered web projects that balance design with performance.
</p>

<p>I’m naturally drawn to how things work — from exploring code logic to reading about biochemical systems and data-driven research. That curiosity pushes me to keep experimenting, testing, and learning beyond tutorials. I enjoy solving problems, understanding systems, and improving what I build, whether it’s a small front-end layout or a full interactive project.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m deeply interested in **science, research, and innovation**. I hope to one day merge my love for technology and biochemistry — creating tools that make research more accessible and data more understandable. For now, I’m focused on sharpening my web development skills, collaborating on creative projects, and continuously growing as a developer who values clarity, curiosity, and impact.
