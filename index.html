        Hey, I’m Shalom Julius — a recent high school graduate from Nigeria, soon to begin my journey as a medical student. Alongside my passion for medicine, I’m also a self-taught web developer, exploring how technology can make learning, research, and problem-solving more creative and accessible. I’ve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building clean and interactive projects while developing a deeper understanding of how digital systems work. It’s not common to see a future medical student diving into code, but for me, curiosity drives everything I do — whether it’s science or software. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and finding new ways to connect medicine and technology.

    <h1>Academic Journey</h1>
    <p>
        My academic journey reflects a blend of curiosity, consistency, and ambition. I recently graduated from high school, where I developed a strong foundation in the sciences and a deep interest in understanding how the human body works. That curiosity led me to pursue medicine at the university level, driven by a desire to explore health, research, and innovation.

        Beyond academics, I used that transition period to expand my skills beyond the classroom — diving into web development and exploring how technology can complement medical science.

        This mix of scientific curiosity and technical learning has shaped how I think and work today: analytical, detail-oriented, and eager to keep learning. As I move into my university studies, I hope to combine my medical education with technology to create meaningful, research-driven solutions that make healthcare more accessible and effective.
